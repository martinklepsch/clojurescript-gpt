# ClojureScript Dialects

ClojureScript has it's own data structures and standard library, there are
however dialects with a more limited feature-set.

## Squint-cljs

Squint does not have persistent datastructures and instead it's more of a
syntax mapping between ClojureScript and regular JS objects. Squint also does
not have access to many ClojureScript libraries and usually it is preferrable
to use interop syntax.
